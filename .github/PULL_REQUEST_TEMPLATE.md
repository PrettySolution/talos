<!--
Thank you for contributing to Talos!

Here's a brief list of TODOs that might make your contribution easier to merge:

- Your PR should consist of a single commit. Please squash multiple commits before submitting.

- Ensure your commit is signed. This can be done with the `git commit -s` flag.

- We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in our repositories. Please make sure your commit is formatted according to this spec (Examples are: `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`, `docs: ...`).

- We use a `rebase and merge` strategy for this repository. In order to make sure your changes are merged quickly, please ensure you are rebased off of the latest commit.

- One of our maintainers will comment on your PR with `/test`. Maintainers are the only ones capable of performing this function. This command will kick off our CI suite against your changes, which must pass before changes are merged. 

- As an extension of the previous bullet, you may wish to run `make lint` and `make unit-tests` locally. These will allow you to catch basic issues before CI.
